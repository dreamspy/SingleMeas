Readme - Thorlabs TXP PAX VISA Instrument Driver
______________________________________________________________________________

This instrument driver package was created with NI-LabWindows/CVI 7.1. The
LabVIEW version of this driver was generated converting the CVI version with
NI-LabVIEW 7.1. 

Note: A convenient way to import the driver directly to your NI-LabView 
environment is to use the NI-LabView 'Import CVI Instrument Driver' 
functionality.

This driver needs a NI-VISA library to be installed. You may download a VISA
runtime library on http://www.ni.com/visa .
